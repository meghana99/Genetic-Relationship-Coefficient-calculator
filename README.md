# Genetic-Relationship-Coefficient-calculator

Program to calculate the degree of relatedness between two people in the family tree. 
The calculation is based on the coefficient of relationship which is a measure of the proportion of genes that is common

relatedness but it is an estimate of the average degree of relatedness for a given pair of individuals.
